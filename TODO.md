# TODO:

Drop explorer on screen (4x size?)
- have her move with CommaOAE
- have her face the cursor
    
Draw sword telegraph in front of explorer
- move it in and out slightly based on mouse distance
- click and animate
    
Add some things to hit
- set up tile reporting; draw some temp tiles
- set up pixel collision within tiles
    
Set camera
- pseudo centered on explorer, slight offset for cursor
    
Basic level formating
- floor, walls
- enemies, spawners with rules
- objects, doors
    
A few enemies
- (slimes first? :wink:)
- small and fast
- immobile turret
- knight sized, a bit slow
- big and slow, AOE
    
Gun and redo projectile objects if needed
    
Reconsider art direction
- 2.5D? Voxel 3D? Proper 3D?
- I think I'll stick to 2.5D, with an entirely 2D data set. This should help avoid some of the problems Spiral knights had with collisions on it's Z axis!
- Recode with flat data layer, and with pretty 2.5d/layer
- Tiles? Isometric?

Puzzle and trap tiles
- buttons, switches, gates
- spikes

- handcrafted rooms, hallways
- determine how many and piece together
